Description:

This POC demonstrates a stock data analysis system where users interact with stock data and news through separate APIs. The system consists of several components: MySQL (mysql) stores stock data, while the stock-fetcher periodically fetches stock data based on user-defined tickers. The stock-news-fetcher scrapes and stores news articles in MongoDB (mongodb). The FastAPI service (fastapi) serves two distinct APIsâ€”one for querying stock data from MySQL and another for fetching news from MongoDB. Additionally, it queries the Gemini language model to generate insights based on both the stock data and news. The Streamlit front-end (streamlit) displays textual answers and insights to the user.
